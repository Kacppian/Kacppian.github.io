title: Here I am

summary: You went out and had a good time

---

I've been wanting to write something for so long, but I'd always lacked any substantial
content to really keep a blog going. I guess I'd forgotten that blogs can be so
useful when written as letters to myself. Whatever you're going through, reading this
might help.

## Where am I, again?

I went out to grab some lunch with my girlfriend today. I'll be moving
to a new city in a week. She'd come over to bid her goodbyes to my room. It's a room that I decorated from when it was bare and lacked any personality. She's seen it change from a dump to a decent place she'd like to spend time at, so it means a lot to both of us.

As we waited for our turn to find a table, we kept wondering how stupid it feels to be waiting
for a table to eat. We waited regardless, the queue was short and moving fast. The table
was ready in 15 minutes and we ordered almost immediately.

## Hmm, what did you do?

We ate for at least an hour, the table next to us got allotted twice ~! As we ate, we'd
talked about so many things like, the North Indian thali she'd ordered barely differed
from the South Indian thali I'd ordered, how the family sitting beside was staring
at us, and how the ambience was so family-like.

So many times in life, you'll be bogged down by decisions you'll have to make, the thought
behind it, and the consequences. I felt so good to be just away after so long, with no
nagging feeling at the back of the mind. It's so difficult to containerize and orchestrate our
emotions. Wish there was a kubernetes for emotions, emotionetes maybe? Anyway, willful ignorance
is the true bliss attained by a select few. I felt happy in the moment. Something as simple as eating and talking about random things made me so calm. Made me wonder, what do I need to be happy? a naive impluse was to say *roti, kapda, makaan*.

Isn't that all we need? No, there are two more things I think we need - **a sense of accomplishment** and **people** ~! These 5 ingredients are the absolute musts. Despite all this, there's going to be 1 more
monster knocking at the door - comparison.

## My Life < Their Life

Comparison is inevitable. Not everyone starts from the same starting line, runs at the same pace,
or runs on the same track. You will ineviably be envious of others' success. I don't know how you're
going to deal with it, but please don't trivialize their life/work or yours.

I think listening to Nietzsche talk about how people you're envious of are the versions of you that you wish to be helps in dealing with it. Embracing envy and using it towards gaining a sense of accomplishment
is important. Of course, there's always envy you can't embrace and such envy will lead to sadness. That kind of sadness can't be escaped and it's okay to suffer.


## That was underwhelming, tbh

I know, most good advice is purely underwhelming. That's probably why it's good advice. That
brings us to the last ingredient, people. I'll talk about in detail at some other point, for now, people
are very important in shaping you. You're, most likely, the average of the 5 people you're spending time with.

That's about it, now get back to whatever you were doing.
